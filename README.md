Rope is a public Kite registry with proxy support between kites. Also
introduces bi-directional communication between Kites.

Getting Started
---------------

Before starting make sure to call `npm install` and
`go get github.com/koding/kite` if you want to try go example.
Then to start Rope server;

```
 $ npm start
```

This will start the server on `0.0.0.0:3210` which then you can run one of
the node examples (in another terminal session);

```
 $ node nodes/js/rope-node.js
```

will create a Rope Node with Node.js, same file also supports browsers which
you can try it out with;

```
 $ open nodes/js/index.html
```

will load the `kite.js` bundle and then runs the `rope-node.js` which will
create another Rope Node in the browser this time.

To try another Rope Node in Go this time;

```
 $ go run nodes/go/rope-node.go
```

Once ready, you can start playing with nodes by calling `run` over
`Rope Server`. The best way to do that for now opening Dev Console in your
choice of Browser after loading the `nodes/js/index.html`. Which will connect
to `Rope Server`, identifies itself and will get a list of Kites registered
before which you can access from `publicKites` global variable. There will be
another public variable called `kite` which will allow you to interact with
`Rope Server`. And for an example of usage of `run` over `Rope Server` would
be (in Dev Console of nodes/js/index.html);

## `kite.ping`

```
 > kite.tell('run', {
      kiteId: publicKites[0].id,
      method: "kite.ping"
   }).then(console.log.bind(console))

 pong
```
will ping the first public kite which will end with a simple `pong`


## `kite.systemInfo`

```
 > kite.tell('run', {
      kiteId: publicKites[0].id,
      method: "kite.systemInfo"
   }).then(console.log.bind(console))

 {
   diskTotal: 975902848,
   diskUsage: 328007624,
   homeDir: "/Users/rope",
   memoryUsage: 12602589184,
   state: "RUNNING",
   totalMemoryLimit: 17179869184,
   uname: "darwin",
 }
```
will return the system info from first public kite.


## `kite.prompt`

```
 > kite.tell('run', {
      kiteId: publicKites[0].id,
      method: "kite.prompt",
      args: ["Your Name? "]
   }).then(console.log.bind(console))

 # on the terminal of first public kite you will see the prompt "Your Name? "

   $ go run nodes/go/rope-node.go

   Your Name? Gokmen

 # once provided it will return the result to the browser console.
 Gokmen
```

## `square`

```
 > kite.tell('run', {
      kiteId: publicKites[0].id,
      method: "square",
      args: [5]
   }).then(console.log.bind(console))
